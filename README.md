Mastering SQL Joins in PostgreSQL- Coursera
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project involves performing various SQL join operations to retrieve and analyze data from multiple tables in a database. It includes tasks such as using INNER JOIN to combine data from two tables, handling duplicate records, and applying LEFT and RIGHT JOINs to capture all relevant records from one or both tables. The project also demonstrates how to use joins with WHERE clauses for filtering results, incorporates aggregate functions to summarize data, and explores joining more than two tables to understand complex relationships within the dataset. Overall, it aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of SQL joins and their practical applications in data retrieval and analysis.

Steps Involved:

1- Retrieving data from the tables in the database

2- Retrieving data from the two tables using INNER JOIN

3- Retrieving data from the two tables with duplicate records using INNER JOIN

4- Retrieving data from the two tables using LEFT JOIN

5- Retrieving data from the two tables using RIGHT JOIN

6- Retrieving data from tables using JOIN and WHERE together

7- Using Aggregate Functions with Joins

8- Joining more than Two Tables in SQL
